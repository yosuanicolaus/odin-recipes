    <h3>Hmmm... My favourite</h3>
    <p><em>"Indomie, seleraku".</em> Indomie is an instant noodle. But not just your regular instant noodle. It's an incredibly delicious instant noodle that will make you fall in love with it the moment you take a bite. Seriously. It's that good! Best of all? it's hella cheap! Only IDR2.500,00 (0.18 USD) here in Indonesia!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Indomie</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>heat the water</li>
        <li>open Indomie's container, put the noodle in the water once it's 100C degree (when it boils)</li>
        <li>while you're waiting for the noodle to soften in the water, open the sauce included in Indomie. <em>This is the real key of what makes Indomie taste so damn good.</em></li>
        <li>after the noodle is done, exclude the water by throwing it away somewhere. Then, put your noodle in with the sauce.</li>
        <li>your Indomie is done! Happy eating!</li>
